# Web Scraping Dynamic Website Using Selenium

> A practical project showcasing automated data extraction from dynamically rendered web pages using Python and Selenium.

## 🎯 Goal

To scrape and structure data from a dynamic website (JavaScript-rendered) by automating browser interactions and exporting the results in a usable format.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates the process of scraping content from dynamic web pages where traditional methods like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` fall short due to JavaScript content loading.

Using Selenium, we simulate browser behavior, interact with DOM elements, and retrieve data reliably from modern web apps.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔧 Automates dynamic content scraping via browser simulation
* 🖱️ Supports user interaction (e.g., clicking buttons, dropdowns)
* 📊 Data output to CSV or JSON formats
* 💻 Custom wait strategies for reliable scraping
* ✅ Tested on ChromeDriver and Firefox (geckodriver)

## 🧭 Development Steps

1. Inspect dynamic page structure
2. Set up Selenium WebDriver and browser
3. Locate and interact with key DOM elements
4. Extract content and parse into structured format
5. Handle pagination, infinite scroll, or JS triggers
6. Export cleaned data to CSV/JSON

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add multi-page crawling and error handling
* Integrate proxy rotation and headless mode
* Export data to databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
* Deploy on a schedule using cron or Airflow
